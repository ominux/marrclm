\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:preliminary}

In this section, we will describe the background of ReRAM technology, switching mechanism of the device and characteristics of retention failure observed in some ReRAM resistance states.

\subsection{Background}
The basic structure of a ReRAM cell is a metal layer sandwiched between two metal electrodes, called metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure. The switching from HRS to LRS is defined as SET operation while the opposite process is RESET operation. The switching modes of ReRAM can be broadly classified into two modes: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar means SET/RESET operation only depends the amplitude of the applied voltage/current but not on the polarity. Bipolar means SET and RESET occurs at different polarity. The switching mechanism and characteristics does not only depend on the choice of metal oxide layer but also the electrode materials and their interfacial properties. Some of prosing oxide materials include $H_fO_x$, $T_iO_x$, $T_aO_x$, $N_iO_x$. An extremely fast switching (<0.3ns) has been reported for $H_fO_x$-based ReRAM [?ITRI?] and its endurance bar was recently raised to $10^{12}$ [??]. $T_aO_x$-based ReRAM has also demonstrated nanosecond switching [??] with endurance greater than $10^{12}$ [??]. $T_iO_x$ was interesting because of its intrinsic nonlinearity provides a low-cost solution for building crosspoint structure[?HP?]. Among all the ReRAM technologies, $H_fO_x$ seems to be have balanced metrics in switching time, switching energy, resistance ratio and endurance. Later in our case studies we will use $H_fO_x$-based ReRAM as an example. However, the discussion and solution we will have can be broadly applied for most ReRAM technologies with MLC capability.

\subsection{MLC programming}
The triggering of switching behavior of ReRAM is closely related to the formation of rupture of so-called conductive filament (CF), which consists of oxygen filaments. Once a filament is created inside the metal oxide layer and connects top electrode with bottom electrode, electrons can hop through the CF resulting in a LRS of the cell. The strength of the CFs is determined by the diameter or the number of CFs. The stronger (larger or more number of) the CFs are formed, the lower resistance the LRS is. Similarly, the rupture of CFs disconnects two metal electrodes and create a HRS of the cell. The resistance of the HRS is roughly proportional to the rupture length of CFs. Figure ? illustrates the formation process of the CFs in a ReRAM cell and the controlling of CF strength by adjusting the amplitude of SET current. When a positive current passing through the cell, the oxygen atoms are knocked out of the lattice and become negative-charged oxygen ion. The oxygen ions will be drift towards the anode and leaving corresponding oxygen vacancies in the metal oxide layer. CFs are formed when enough oxygen vacancies were created and connected as a conductive path. As we can see from the figure, stronger CFs are formed when more SET current pass though the cell for the same amount of time. This is the fundamental reason that a ReRAM cell can be programmed into intermediate levels of LRS, enabling the feasibility of MLC. The completely opposite MLC programming direction is to vary the RESET voltage so that the rupture length of the CFs can be controlled, as seen in Figure ?. Starting from LRS, we apply a RESET voltage cross the ReRAM cell, thermal diffusion helps the migration of oxygen ions back to the metal oxide layer and combination of oxygen ions with oxygen vacancies. In bipolar ReRAM, a reverse dielectric field only assists
