Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) recently has emerged as
a promising technology to meet the fast growing demand
for large capacity memory in modern computer systems. In
particular, multi-level cell (MLC) ReRAM that stores multiple
bits in a single cell, offers high density with low per-byte
fabrication cost. However, despite many advantages, such
as good scalability and low leakage, ReRAM suffers from slow write operations, which makes it challenging to be integrated in the memory hierarchy.
