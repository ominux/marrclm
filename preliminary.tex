\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:preliminary}

In this section, we will describe the background of ReRAM technology, switching mechanism of the device and characteristics of retention failure observed in some ReRAM resistance states.

\subsection{Background}
The basic structure of a ReRAM cell is a metal layer sandwiched between two metal electrodes, called metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure. The switching from HRS to LRS is defined as SET process while the opposite process is RESET. The switching modes of ReRAM can be broadly classified into two modes: unipolar and bipolar.
