\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:preliminary}

In this section, we will describe the background of ReRAM technology, switching mechanism of the device and characteristics of retention failure observed in some ReRAM resistance states.

\subsection{Background}
The basic structure of a ReRAM cell is a metal layer sandwiched between two metal electrodes, called metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure. The switching from HRS to LRS is defined as SET operation while the opposite process is RESET operation. The switching modes of ReRAM can be broadly classified into two modes: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar means SET/RESET operation only depends the amplitude of the applied voltage/current but not on the polarity. Bipolar means SET and RESET occurs at different polarity.
